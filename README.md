# Reddit-Sidebar

`script.js` is both GreaseMonkey & TamperMonkey compatible.

I like having multiple windows and the right sidebar gets annoying (takes up ~33% of screen real estate), so I fixed that. Didn't find any reasonable premade solutions, but [/u/GameFreak4321 in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/swp8s/feature_request_a_button_to_hide_the_sidebar) had a pretty nice solution.

Basically, instead of completely hiding the sidebar (and breaking some subreddits), we move it off the side of the screen. You can easily scroll right to see it and any repositioned elements will hopefully still appear correctly.

I added `q` as a toggle key, as it doesn't interfere with any of my other shortcuts.
